-PLEASE DO NOT SHOW THIS PORTFOLIO IN CLASS-
My wish in this class is to compare the pop music of Japan (also called City Pop) and the West, particularly of the US based in the late 70's and 80's. To to do this I am comparing two groups of three artists. The Japanese group consist of the artists Taeko Onuki, Miki Matsubara and Haruomi Hasono, especially the first two have become very popular even these days due to the surge of city pop's popularity. The US counterparts are the artists Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Madonna. These artists were chosen due to their popularity in the western world in the 80's. I chose these corpora because I want to explore whether there are distinct differences between the genre of (city) pop as it was in Japan in the 80's vs the pop that was popular in the western world in the same decade. The interesting thing is that the Japanese city pop was influenced by western music.
